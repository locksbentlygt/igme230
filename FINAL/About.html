                <h2>My Final Page:</h2>
                <p>Welcome to my Final Project! the intended goal of this site is to show my capabilities with coding languages like CSS, Js and its large variety of libraries, and HTML. This information would/could be useful to any potential employers who would be interested in hiring me.<br>
                 <h3>About the website:</h3> I chose many of the design formats that I've used on this site was because i was going for a minimal design layout to make sure that the user's focus was always drawn to the game at the center of the screen. This is also why the game's background is drastically different from the background. But I knew that if I left the background blank that the overall page wouldn't be very visually interesting so I added the rainbow gradient background that I found while working on a previous project from this site:https://codepen.io/nohoid/pen/kIfto.
                 for my above and beyond i incorporated a completely foreign javascript library that I had not used until I began working on this project I brought my knowledge from the other javascript libraries that I've used to give myself some context for this library.i also brought my prior design experience to minimize the amount of info on the screen while not sacrificing usability. The source that I used the most would be the YouTube creator The Coding Train's videos on the Matter.js library in it he lays out the basic code for said library and even made a video in which he made Plinko but I did not reference it.<h4>Sources:</h4> The Coding Train's Matter.js playlist
