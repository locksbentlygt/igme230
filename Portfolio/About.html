            <h2>About Me:</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my portfolio website! First a couple things about me, I am a 20ish graphic designer/coder. I grew up in Pittsburgh, PA I like long walks on the beach and I have experience with Javascript, c#, Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop and the P5.js library.<br>
             <h3>About the website:</h3> To create the website you are currently on I used HTML5 and CSS(no premade templates were used). I also mostly used flexbox to position things on the page instead of CSS grid. The largest challenge for me was figuring out how to display
