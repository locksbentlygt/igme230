                I created this graphic of Batman using Adobe Illustrator and the powers of imagination. Also, this is one of my first designs once I got to RIT, so please don't judge it too harshly. Now I know that Batman doesn't exactly fit the description of an animal, but once I had this idea in my head I couldn't at least try and make it. I decided to base this one off of one of my favorite comic covers from a comic titled The Dark Knight Returns.
                 because Batman is one of my favorite fictional characters. </p>
